Avoiding Scams:
Suspicious Emails or Messages:
If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to offer a free Amazon gift card, especially from unknown sources, it's likely a scam. Be careful with any emails asking for personal information or payment.
Fake Websites:
Scammers often create fake websites that look like Amazon to trick people into entering their information. Always make sure you‚Äôre on the official Amazon website (www.amazon.com) before entering any personal or payment details.
Phishing Scams:
If a "free gift card" offer asks you to click a link or give away sensitive details (like your credit card number), it's probably a phishing attempt.

Too Good to Be True:
Any offer that seems too generous or claims to give you a large sum of free gift cards is a red flag.

Always verify the source before trusting any ‚Äúfree‚Äù gift card offers. Stick to reputable websites like Amazon itself, or recognized survey and cashback platforms.
No Contact Info:
Scammers usually don't provide legitimate contact details (like an official phone number or address). Always check for that before trusting any offer.
What to Do if You're Scammed:
If you think you've been scammed and provided your personal information, contact Amazon customer service immediately to report it.
Monitor your bank and credit card statements for any unusual charges.
